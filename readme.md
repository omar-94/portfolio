Portfolio

This web portfolio was designed to showcase the skills that will be attained throughout the course. In describing my background information, the website will also display links/images to the many projects that will be coded into live sites. Viewers of my site will have the ease of navigating through the different links to view sections about me, work, and contact information no matter the screen size upon which the portfolio is being viewed. As the course progresses, changes to the site will be made and recorded.
